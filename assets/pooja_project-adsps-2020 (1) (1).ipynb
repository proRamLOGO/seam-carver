We will use the on-line sessions of the 6th week of the course to illustrate and discuss the contents. **The deadline for submision is Monday October 12th at 8 a.m. Your submission should consist of this same notebook where you have added your code and explanations where we have indicated so.**\n\nThe goal of the project is to let you address a problem that has real applications and that requires good algorithms to be solved. We will work on this together during the on-line sessions and you are expected to do the programming.\n\nAs you will find out there will be opportunities to improve on the algorithms used to solve the problem. We will introduce a technique for doing so called Dynamic Programming in the 7th week for the course and you will get access to a better version (if you have not yourself discovered it before) by the end of the 7th week. \n\nThe project is adapted from an assignment (for Java) from a course on Algorithms at Princeton University [https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall20/cos226/assignments/seam/specification.php ]. \n\nThe problem that is adressed is described in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving ] and this interactive demo illustrates what we want to achieve [https://www.aryan.app/seam-carving/].\n\nSome parts of the program are already in the notebook for you to start experimenting and testing your understanding. You are asked to complete the class ```seam_carving```. You need to provide code where we have indicated so. You are of course allowed to introduce auxiliary functions, but your solutions will be tested by calling the functions we expect you to complete. If you need to use other classes we introduced in the course you are allowed to include them in their own code cell. You should not use other library functions.\n\n# The problem\nSeam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one  pixel of height (or width) at a time. \n\nA *vertical seam* in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottombwith one pixel in each row;\na *horizontal seam* is a path of pixels connected from the left to the right with one pixel in each column.\n\nUnlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (such as cropping and scaling), seam carving preserves the most interest features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image. You can check a gradual shrinking of an image by removing vertical seams in [https://www.aryan.app/seam-carving/].\n\nIn this project you will provide the initial functionality of a class for doing seam carving: functions to calculate vertical and horizontal seams. \n\n# Things You Need to Know\n\n### Notation\nIn image processing, pixel (*x*, *y*) refers to the pixel in column *x* and row *y*, with pixel (0, 0) at the upper-left corner and pixel\n(*W* - 1, *H* - 1) at the lower-right corner. The coordinates in a 3-by-4 image are\n \n|       |       |       | \n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n| (0,0) | (1,0) | (2,0) |\n| (0,1) | (1,1) | (2,1) |\n| (0,2) | (1,2) | (2,2) |\n| (0,3) | (1,3) | (2,3) |\n\n\nBeware: this is the opposite of the standard mathematical notation used in linear algebra, where (*i*, *j*) refers to row *i* and column *j*\nand (0, 0) is at the lower-left corner.\n\nAt each position in the image matrix there is a color given as three integer numbers between 0 and 255. Here are some examples:\n\n| RGB     | Color |\n|:-------:|:-----:|\n| (0,0,0) | Black | \n| (255,255,255) | White | \n| (255,0,0) | Red | \n| (0,255,0) | Green | \n| (0,0,255) | Blue |\n\nColors with the same value in all three numbers are grey colors (the extreme cases being black and white).\n\n### The Energy of an Image\nThe calculation of seams is based on the importance of pixels. The importance is meassured in the form of *energy*. In this project, you will use the *dual-gradient energy function*, which is described below.\n\n<!--See <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1276390\">the original Seam Carving paper</a> for a discussion of different energy functions.-->\n\nHere you can see an image and the energy of each of the pixels: the image with the energy uses the energy value at each pixel to form a grey color. \n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td><img src=\"https://halmstaduniversity.box.com/shared/static/87exr2cqe5ztl79uei0fd9bfbol0fver.jpg\" width = 100></td>\n        <td><img src=\"https://halmstaduniversity.box.com/shared/static/ibc49z3zowosz05i6q6ddq6vi1klmmci.jpg\" width = 100></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\nThe energy is high (white) for pixels in the image where there is a rapid color gradient. **The seam-carving technique avoids removing such high-energy pixels.**\n\n### Seam Identification\n\nThe next step is to find a vertical seam of minimum total energy.\n(Finding a horizontal seam is analogous.)\nThis is similar to the classic shortest path problem\nin an edge-weighted digraph, but there are three important differences:\n\n* The weights are on the vertices instead of the edges.\n\n* The goal is to find the shortest path from *any* of the *W* pixels in the top row\nto *any* of the *W* pixels in the bottom row.\n\n* The directed graph is acyclic, where there is a downward edge from pixel (*x*, *y*) to pixels (*x* - 1, *y* + 1), (*x*, *y* + 1), and (*x* + 1,*y* + 1), assuming that the coordinates are in the prescribed ranges.\n\nSeams cannot wrap around the image (e.g., a vertical seam cannot cross from the leftmost\ncolumn of the image to the rightmost column).\n\n\n### Computing the energy of a pixel\nThis is what you will need to implement in the auxiliary function ```_calculate_energy```.\n\nYou will use the *dual-gradient energy function*: The\nenergy of pixel (x, y) is\n\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta_x^2(x, y) + \\Delta_y^2(x, y)}$\n\nwhere the square of the *x-*gradient\n$\\Delta_x^2(x, y) = R_x(x, y)^2 + G_x(x, y)^2 + B_x(x, y)^2$,\n\nand where the central differences\n$R_x(x, y)$,\n$G_x(x, y)$, and\n$B_x(x, y)$\nare the differences in the red, green, and blue components between\npixel (*x* + 1, *y*) and pixel (*x* - 1, *y*), respectively.\nThe square of the *y*-gradient\n$\\Delta_y^2(x, y)$ is defined in an analogous manner.\n\nTo handle pixels on the borders of the image, calculate energy by\ndefining the leftmost and rightmost columns as adjacent and the topmost and bottommost rows as adjacent. For example, to compute the energy of a pixel (0, *y*) in the leftmost column, use its right neighbor (1, *y*) and its “left” neighbor (*W* - 1, *y*).\n\nAs an example, consider the following 3-by-4 image (the image is in  <a href=\"3x4.png\">3x4.png</a>):\n\n<img src=\"https://halmstaduniversity.box.com/shared/static/q84h9vburwx8zh2an7biw31ll5wlft3i.png\" width=700 >\n\nThe energy of the *non-border pixel* (1, 2) is calculated from pixels (0, 2) and (2, 2) for the *x*-gradient\n\n$R_x$(1, 2) = 255 - 255 = 0, \n\n$G_x$(1, 2) = 205 - 203 = 2, \n\n$B_x$(1, 2) = 255 - 51 = 204, \n\nyielding $\\Delta_x^2 (1, 2)$ = $2^2$ + $204^2$ = $41620$\n\nand pixels (1, 1) and (1, 3) for the *y*-gradient\n\n$R_y$(1, 2) = 255 - 255 = 0,\n\n$G_y$(1, 2) = 255 - 153 = 102, \n\n$B_y$(1, 2) = 153 - 153 = 0\n\nyielding $\\Delta_y^2(1, 2)$ = $102^2$ = $10404$. \n\nThus, the energy of pixel (1, 2) is $\\sqrt{41620 + 10404}$ = $\\sqrt{52024}$.\n\nSimilarly, the energy of pixel (1, 1) is $\\sqrt{204^2 + 103^2}$ = $\\sqrt{52225}$\n\n\nThe energy of the *border pixel* (1, 0) is calculated by using \npixels (0, 0) and (2, 0) for the *x*-gradient\n\n$R_x$(1, 0) = 255 - 255 = 0, \n\n$G_x$(1, 0) = 101 - 101 = 0, \n\n$B_x$(1, 0) = 255 - 51 = 204, \n\nyielding $\\Delta_x^2 (1, 0)$ = $204^2$ = $41616$;\n\nand pixels (1, 3) and (1, 1) for the *y*-gradient\n\n$R_y$(1, 0) = 255 - 255 = 0, \n$G_y$(1, 0) = 255 - 153 = 102, \n$B_y$(1, 0) = 153 - 153 = 0\n\nyielding $\\Delta_y^2 (1, 0)$ = $102^2$ = $10404$. \n\nThus, the energy of pixel (1, 0) is $\\sqrt{41616 + 10404}$ = $\\sqrt{52020}$.\n\n### Finding a Vertical Seam.\nThe ```vertical_seam``` method returns a list of length *H*\nsuch that entry *y* is the column number of the pixel to\nbe removed from row *y* of the image.\nFor example, the dual-gradient energies of a 6-by-5 image\n(see <a href=\"6x5.png\">6x5.png</a>) are shown in the table below.\n\n<img src=\"https://halmstaduniversity.box.com/shared/static/e4r8h1c1md5gjnx3343e0y7z6kb81v8u.png\" width=450>\n\nThe minimum energy vertical seam is highlighted in blue.\nIn this case, the method ```vertical_seam``` returns the list \\[3, 4, 3, 2, 2\\]\nbecause the pixels in the minimum energy vertical seam are\n(3, 0),\n(4, 1),\n(3, 2),\n(2, 3), and\n(2, 4).\n<!--\nRemember that seams cannot wrap around the image.\nWhen there are multiple vertical seams with minimal total energy, your method can return\nany such seam.\n-->\n\n### Finding a Horizontal Seam.\nThe behavior of ```horizontal_seam``` is\nanalogous to that of ```vertical_seam``` except that it returns\na list of length *W* such that entry *x* is the row number of \nthe pixel to be removed from column *x* of the image.\nFor the 6-by-5 image, the method ```horizontal_seam``` \nreturns the list \\[ 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 \\]\nbecause the pixels in the minimum energy horizontal seam are\n(0, 2),\n(1, 2),\n(2, 1),\n(3, 2),\n(4, 1), and\n(5, 2).\n\n<img src=\"https://halmstaduniversity.box.com/shared/static/777ltsw6j5rn2xi8n519qcpoiez4ob7l.png\" width=450>\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# The class you have to complete\nimport math\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nclass seam_carving:\n    # --- constructor ---\n    def __init__(self,  filename):\n        # two pixel matrices: the source and the current version\n        # The methods will work on the current version\n        self._source_im  = Image.open(filename)    \n\n        self._current_im = Image.open(filename)\n        self._current    = self._current_im.load()\n\n        # a matrix to store the energy of each pixel\n        self._energy = [None] * self._source_im.width\n        for x in range(self._source_im.width):\n            self._energy[x] = [0] * self._source_im.height\n        self._calculate_energy()\n        \n        \n    # --- methods ---\n    \n    # width of current image\n    def width(self):\n        return self._current_im.width\n    \n    # height of current image \n    def height(self):\n        return self._current_im.height\n    \n    def source(self): return self._source_im\n    \n    def current(self): return self._current\n    \n    def energy_im(self):\n        # use energy as grey values.
