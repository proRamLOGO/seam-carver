    "This notebook provides you with a description of the programming project included in the course. We will use the on-line sessions of the 6th week of the course to illustrate and discuss the contents. **The deadline for submision is Monday October 12th at 8 a.m. Your submission should consist of this same notebook where you have added your code and explanations where we have indicated so.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to let you address a problem that has real applications and that requires good algorithms to be solved. We will work on this together during the on-line sessions and you are expected to do the programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will find out there will be opportunities to improve on the algorithms used to solve the problem. We will introduce a technique for doing so called Dynamic Programming in the 7th week for the course and you will get access to a better version (if you have not yourself discovered it before) by the end of the 7th week. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is adapted from an assignment (for Java) from a course on Algorithms at Princeton University [https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall20/cos226/assignments/seam/specification.php ]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that is adressed is described in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving ] and this interactive demo illustrates what we want to achieve [https://www.aryan.app/seam-carving/].\n",
    "\n",
    "Some parts of the program are already in the notebook for you to start experimenting and testing your understanding. You are asked to complete the class ```seam_carving```. You need to provide code where we have indicated so. You are of course allowed to introduce auxiliary functions, but your solutions will be tested by calling the functions we expect you to complete. If you need to use other classes we introduced in the course you are allowed to include them in their own code cell. You should not use other library functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The problem\n",
    "Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one  pixel of height (or width) at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *vertical seam* in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottombwith one pixel in each row;\n",
    "a *horizontal seam* is a path of pixels connected from the left to the right with one pixel in each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (such as cropping and scaling), seam carving preserves the most interest features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image. You can check a gradual shrinking of an image by removing vertical seams in [https://www.aryan.app/seam-carving/].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will provide the initial functionality of a class for doing seam carving: functions to calculate vertical and horizontal seams. \n",

    "### Notation\n",
    "In image processing, pixel (*x*, *y*) refers to the pixel in column *x* and row *y*, with pixel (0, 0) at the upper-left corner and pixel\n",
    "(*W* - 1, *H* - 1) at the lower-right corner. The coordinates in a 3-by-4 image are\n",

    "| (0,1) | (1,1) | (2,1) |\n",
    "| (0,2) | (1,2) | (2,2) |\n",
    "| (0,3) | (1,3) | (2,3) |\n",

    "and (0, 0) is at the lower-left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each position in the image matrix there is a color given as three integer numbers between 0 and 255. Here are some examples:\n",

    "Colors with the same value in all three numbers are grey colors (the extreme cases being black and white).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Energy of an Image\n",
    "The calculation of seams is based on the importance of pixels. The importance is meassured in the form of *energy*. In this project, you will use the *dual-gradient energy function*, which is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--See <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1276390\">the original Seam Carving paper</a> for a discussion of different energy functions.-->\n",

    "    </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy is high (white) for pixels in the image where there is a rapid color gradient. **The seam-carving technique avoids removing such high-energy pixels.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seam Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to find a vertical seam of minimum total energy.\n",
    "(Finding a horizontal seam is analogous.)\n",
    "This is similar to the classic shortest path problem\n",
    "in an edge-weighted digraph, but there are three important differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The weights are on the vertices instead of the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The goal is to find the shortest path from *any* of the *W* pixels in the top row\n",
    "to *any* of the *W* pixels in the bottom row.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The directed graph is acyclic, where there is a downward edge from pixel (*x*, *y*) to pixels (*x* - 1, *y* + 1), (*x*, *y* + 1), and (*x* + 1,*y* + 1), assuming that the coordinates are in the prescribed ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seams cannot wrap around the image (e.g., a vertical seam cannot cross from the leftmost\n",
    "column of the image to the rightmost column).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing the energy of a pixel\n",
    "This is what you will need to implement in the auxiliary function ```_calculate_energy```.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the *dual-gradient energy function*: The\n",
    "energy of pixel (x, y) is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sqrt{\\Delta_x^2(x, y) + \\Delta_y^2(x, y)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the square of the *x-*gradient\n",
    "$\\Delta_x^2(x, y) = R_x(x, y)^2 + G_x(x, y)^2 + B_x(x, y)^2$,\n",
    "\n",
    "and where the central differences\n",
    "$R_x(x, y)$,\n",
    "$G_x(x, y)$, and\n",
    "$B_x(x, y)$\n",
    "are the differences in the red, green, and blue components between\n",
    "pixel (*x* + 1, *y*) and pixel (*x* - 1, *y*), respectively.\n",
    "The square of the *y*-gradient\n",
    "$\\Delta_y^2(x, y)$ is defined in an analogous manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle pixels on the borders of the image, calculate energy by\n",
    "defining the leftmost and rightmost columns as adjacent and the topmost and bottommost rows as adjacent. For example, to compute the energy of a pixel (0, *y*) in the leftmost column, use its right neighbor (1, *y*) and its “left” neighbor (*W* - 1, *y*).\n",
